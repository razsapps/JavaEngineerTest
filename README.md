JavaEngineerTest
================

The end goal of this project is to eventaully help java programmers test thier skills.  I'm hoping to focus on data structures and algorithms.

I expect this to work by a developer implementing the classes that end in Questions.  There will eventually be unit tests that test the developer got the correct answer, defensive programming measurements were used, and they did it the most efficient way as possible.

All answers will go under a different branch.
